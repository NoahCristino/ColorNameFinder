# ColorNameFinder
# About
This program allows you to find the real name for any color in a picture!
Now you can learn the proper names of any color that you want.
# Examples
![Patrick](http://en.spongepedia.org/images/0/0f/Happy-patrick-star.jpg)

What color do you think Patrick is? Well using my program you can find out that he is [Geraldine](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/hex/F37370)!

# How to Use
To use this program simply install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and all of the prerequisite packages: 
* numpy
* argparse
* opencv
* tkinter
* pillow

You can find these packages at [pypi](https://pypi.org/), for help installing read [this](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) document.

Now just do `python detect.py YOURIMAGE.jpg`
your image will then popup and everytime you click on a part of the image the color name will appear in the terminal.
